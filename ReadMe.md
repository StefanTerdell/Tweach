# Tweach

## What is it?

Tweach is a hierarchy viewer and inspector for viewing and making changes to components
and scripts variables at runtime. The UI is optimized for touch controls, making it a
great companion when developing and tweaking mobile games. No more waiting for a build,
realizing you left an Int at 4 that's supposed to be a 5, and promptly rebuilding the
whole thing. Just open up Tweach and change it on the fly.

## How do I install it?
Download the unitypackage in the root folder and import into your project by clicking
Assets > Import Package > Custom Package... 

## How do I open Tweach at runtime?

Just instantiate the prefab Tweach.prefab in the main folder into your scene and the
scripts will do the rest. Dont forget to pause your game. The script TweachActivator
in the base tweach folder contains an example.

## What does Tweach mean?
Touch Tweak ^^
